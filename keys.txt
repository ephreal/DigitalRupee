Place all masternode keys above this message.
Placing any keys below this message will cause
this message to instead be interpreted as your
private key list.

This file is an example for a 20 masternode 
setup. This means there are 20 (fake) private 
keys above.

Delete all the fake private keys provided when
setting this file up yourself. Place each key
on it's own line, starting from the top of the
file. If you have a blank line in between any of
your private keys, that blank line WILL be
inserted as a private key.

The best possible option for placing your keys
in this file is to delete everything and place
each key on it's own line, directly under the
previous key.
